# Language-Model-using-LSTM-GRU


In this project, we developed a language model using William Shakespears sonet corpus. The model required text processing, tokenization and having indepth knowlege of  RNNS, LSTM ,GRU  and working preinciple of language model. ones the model was trained , it could generate texts whose vocabulary was one, used by Shakespear. In fact the text generated sounded like poetry written by William Shakespear.
